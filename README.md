# keypadCode
My code for our keypad project in Cybersecurity Capstone, utilizing the Raspberry Pi Model 3B's GPIO pins.
A lot of this code was shamelessly ripped from [Maker.pro](https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/how-to-use-a-keypad-with-a-raspberry-pi-4), so much thanks to Daniel Hertz for that. I used his code to get basic function for the hardware, but the actual code-entry source code I forked from it myself. Have fun, build cool things.
